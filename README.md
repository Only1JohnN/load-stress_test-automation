## Features

- **Load Testing**: Simulate normal and peak load conditions using JMeter or Python `pytest` to evaluate application performance under typical usage.
- **Stress Testing**: Assess system behavior under extreme conditions using JMeter or Python `pytest` to identify potential breaking points and performance degradation.
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generate detailed reports with JMeter and `pytest` to analyze performance metrics and identify bottlenecks.
- **Customizable Configurations**: Easily adjust testing parameters and scenarios to fit different applications and environments.
- **Integration with Pytest**: Utilize `pytest` for running additional custom tests and generating reports.

## Requirements

- **JMeter**: For creating and running load and stress tests.
- **Python**: For custom scripts and integrations.
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Used for structuring test automation in a maintainable and scalable way.
- **pytest**: Framework for running Python tests and generating reports.
- **Requests Library**: For making HTTP requests in Python tests.

## Setup

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Only1JohnN/Load-Stress-Test-Automation.git
cd Load-Stress-Test-Automation
```

### Create a Python Virtual Environment

To avoid conflicts between dependencies, it's recommended to use a virtual environment. You can create one using `venv`:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- **On Windows:**

    ```bash
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

- **On macOS/Linux:**

    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

### Install Python Dependencies

Install the required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Install JMeter

Follow the instructions on the [Apache JMeter website](https://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi) to download and install JMeter.

### Configure Your Tests

- **JMeter Tests**: Modify the JMeter configuration files and test scripts according to your application’s requirements. Update parameters such as URLs, endpoints, and test data as needed.

- **Pytest Tests**: Write or configure your Python test scripts for load and stress testing. Update URLs and parameters in `load_test.py` and `stress_test.py` as needed.

### Run Load Tests with JMeter

Execute load testing scripts using JMeter:

```bash
jmeter -n -t jmeter/load_test_script.jmx -l results/load_test_results.jtl
```

### Run Stress Tests with JMeter

Execute stress testing scripts similarly:

```bash
jmeter -n -t jmeter/stress_test_script.jmx -l results/stress_test_results.jtl
```

### Run Load Tests with Pytest

Execute Python load tests using `pytest`:

```bash
pytest python/load_test.py
```

### Run Stress Tests with Pytest

Execute Python stress tests using `pytest`:

```bash
pytest python/stress_test.py
```

### Review Reports

- **JMeter Reports**: Analyze the `.jtl` results files or use JMeter’s reporting tools to generate detailed performance reports.
- **Pytest Reports**: Review the output from `pytest` to assess the performance of your application under load and stress conditions.
